Raspberry Pi setup

Flash Rasbian onto SD card
create an empty text file named ssh to the root directory
install sd card into rpi
log in using putty with pi raspberry
sudo raspi-config
update
hostname -I 
Copy public key to rPi:
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh pi@192.168.86.25 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'

sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade

Install the Mosquitto Broker:
	sudo apt install -y mosquitto mosquitto-clients

Auto start on boot:
	sudo systemctl enable mosquitto.service
	
Test the installation:
	mosquitto -v  
	(Note: sometimes the command mosquitto -v prompts a warning message saying “Error: Address already in use“. That warning message means that your Mosquitto Broker is already running, so don’t worry about that.)
	
sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
